# AugmentedReality
Under grad project using Unity 3d Engine, C# &amp; Vuforia to build a augmented reality application

##Project summary

In this project I hope to build an augmented reality project using C#. the Unity 3d Engine, and the Vuforia SDK. The project will use the 
default camera of a device to augment what is displayed on screen. When the camera is shown a plain (a blank piece of paper) it will 
replace this augmenting what is displayed on the devices screen.
