# AugmentedReality
Under grad project using Unity 3d Engine, and C# to build a augmented reality application

## Project summary

In this project I hope to build a markerless augmented reality project using C#, and the Unity 3d Engine. The project will use the 
default camera of a device to augment what is displayed on screen. I will also use the devices gyroscope, & audio output devices for
rotational & sound.
